# About Path Planning 

"Path planning is a process to identify or predict an object's ability to move from the origin to the destination.


It is commonly used in aviation, robotics and computer games.
In aviation, pilots have to do path planning before every flight in order to make sure the flight route is possible to run through.

Except for pilots, ATCs have to arrange flights around and in the airport too.
As a result, path-planning is really important to the aviation industry since it can ensure our safety and reduce flight costs."

### Code
  "In this project, the group was given the task to modify an A-Star Algorithm code provided by the lecturers to match the required obstacles of the group.  In this algorithm, however, the group located an error in the calculations for the costs of the fuel-consuming and time-consuming area, specifically in lines 149 and 155 of the original code (a_star_noted.py).  In these calculations, the cost of fuel (C<sub>f</sub>) and time (C<sub>t</sub>) were not multiplied to the additional trip fuel (ΔF<sub>a</sub>) and time (ΔT<sub>a</sub>) required, resulting in a cost a little short of what it is supposed to be.  The group was able to resolve this error, as shown below."
